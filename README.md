# LogicAlarmClock
This is not an ordinary alarm clock. You need to set an alarm as you wish. What makes it different from the ordinary alarms is that you need to answer a question to switch off the alarm. 
This Alarm Clock will definitely get you out of bed and I bet you won't be getting back to bed again any time soon.
